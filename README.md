# dondon.dev - Digital Garden ðŸŒ±

My personal digital garden where I grow and share ideas about tech, programming, food, photography, and whatever else feels right to talk about. I just want to create stuff that I can share with others and hopefully have some engaging conversations and share some insights.

## ðŸŒ¿ What's Growing

### Seeds
Small, small, small. I finally understand conceptually how digital gardening is supposed to work. I will be posting frequent small thoughts and pieces. I think the quote that made it click for me was, "treat posts how you might have treated twitter." That is exactly what I want my seeds to be. Just anything that sparks my interest or small bits of knowledge that I want to share. What's cool about this space is that, once those thoughts exist here, I can expand on them and turn them into whatever makes sense!

### Gallery
In a past life, I got a photography degree from Ohio State. I actually got my career in tech started as a photographer and graphic designer. That led to a little bit of web design, then web development, then just software development. Somewhere in the mix, I lost sight of photography. But I'm making a concerted effort to start picking up the camera more again. I hope to post more photos here frequently.

Gallery content structure:
```bash
src
â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ albums/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ hiking-trip/
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ cover.jpg
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ photo1.jpg

## ðŸŒ± Garden Philosophy

This isn't meant to be polished or perfect. I'm talking to myself mostly. Seeds become sprouts, sprouts become posts, posts get updated and evolve. The messy, incomplete stuff is often the most valuable because it shows real thinking in progress.
