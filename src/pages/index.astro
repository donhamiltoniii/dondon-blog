    <h2>Welcome to my digital garden ðŸŒ±</h2>
    <p>This is my space to grow and share ideas about tech concepts, programming, coding, and anything else that makes sense to share about me. Think of it as part side project showcase, learning in public journal, regular journal, and collection of various educational materials. Also, hopefully some photos every now and again.</p>

    <h2>What I'm about</h2>
    <p>I'm passionate about building <s>useful</s> things with code and writing about it. My current interests include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Web Development</strong>: TypeScript, React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
      <li><strong>Infrastructure</strong>: Linux, Docker, Kubernetes</li>
      <li><strong>Workflow</strong>: Vim (because life's too short for slow editing)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What you'll find here</h2>
    <p>This isn't meant to be polished or curated. This is my workshop â€” messy, constantly evolving, and full of projects and ideas in various stages of completion.</p>
    <p>Wander around and you might discover:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tutorials</strong> on setting up self-hosted services and building software</li>
      <li><strong>Notes</strong> on programming concepts I'm learning or random shit I'm interested in at the moment</li>
      <li><strong>Guides</strong> for clarifying concepts that were/are hard for me to understand</li>
      <li><strong>Thoughts</strong> on things you may or may not care about</li>
      <li><strong>Projects</strong> I'm currently breaking and fixing</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Let's connect</h2>
    <p>I believe the best learning happens through sharing and conversation. Feel free to reach out if something here sparks your interest, you have questions about a tutorial, or you just want to geek out about Vim keybindings.</p>
