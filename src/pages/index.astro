    <h2>Welcome to my digital garden ðŸŒ±</h2>
    <p>
      This is my space to grow and share the things I am passionate about. Ideas
      about tech concepts, programming, coding, recipes, photos, etc. Think of
      it as part side project showcase, learning in public journal, regular
      journal, and collection of various educational materials. Also, hopefully
      some photos every now and again.

    <h2>What I'm about</h2>
    <p>
      I'm passionate about building <s>useful</s> things with code and writing about
      it. I also want to use this space to empower more people to use tech to their
      advantage instead of feeding content to big tech outlets. It is my goal to
      share my interests in tech with as many people as possible to give others the
      power to curate their own personal space online without having to support big
      tech institutions. The tools I use for this are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Web Development</strong>: TypeScript, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
        (including various frontend frameworks and libraries)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Infrastructure</strong>: Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, FluxCD,
        ArgoCD
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Workflow</strong>: Vim and, increasingly, Neovim
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What you'll find here</h2>
    <p>
      This isn't meant to be polished or curated. This is my workshop â€” messy,
      constantly evolving, and full of projects and ideas in various stages of
      completion.
    </p>
    <p>Wander around and you might discover:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Tutorials</strong> on setting up self-hosted services, building software,
        and other tech educational content
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Notes</strong> on programming concepts I'm learning or random shit
        I'm interested in at the moment
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Recipes</strong> I've collected and enjoy making (because developers
        need to eat too)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Photo Gallery</strong> with albums of images from my adventures and
        daily life
      </li>

        <strong>Guides</strong> for clarifying concepts that were/are hard for me
        to understand

    <h2>Let's connect</h2>
    <p>
      I believe the best learning happens through sharing and conversation. Feel
      free to reach out if something here sparks your interest, you have
      questions about a tutorial, want to share your favorite recipe, or you
      just want to geek out about Vim keybindings.
