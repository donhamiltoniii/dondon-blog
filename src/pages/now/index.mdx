  This is a "Now" page. Read about why you're about to make one [here](https://nownownow.com/about).

  - I am currently working at the Gap as a Staff Software Developer.
  - My wife gave birth to a beautiful baby girl last month named Emma Sophia Hamilton!
  - I have two dogs, Martha and Huxley, and three cats, Wallace, Edgar, and Stephen.
  - I have definitely developed a hobby out of homelabbing and have made 3 different hosting platforms in my house now
    - One of them uses Portainer/Docker
    - Another uses Docker Compose, Traefik as a reverse proxy, and Watchtower to keep all images up-to-date
      - This is apparently industry standard and I'm having a lot of fun learning more about that setup
    - My final setup uses K3S and ArgoCD to run services
      - This setup is definitely overkill for a homelab but it let's me explore more enterprise level infrastructure
      - This actually mimics the setup that I am using at work at the moment
  - I am pursuing more photography these days which is really nice
  - I have recently migrated all of my personal machines to use linux instead of any other operating system
    - This gives me consistency across all of my devices
    - Bye macOS!
      - Side note, old mac machines can run forever just by putting some linux distro on them
