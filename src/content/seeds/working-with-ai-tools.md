title: Working With AI Tools

I've recently been working a lot more with Claude Sonnet 4. I have a lot of conflicting feelings about AI. But I have been working with this tool in an effort to understand exactly what it does well and see if there is anything beneficial that I can incorporate into my workflow. It turns out, I have definitely found useful applications. I'm going to list anything I find useful here.

---

I have been using Claude Sonnet 4 as sort of a glorified search engine. Most recently, I have been trying to use Obsidian more effectively. I have been trying to use Obsidian as a complementary tool to my analog notebooks. I ran up against an issue where Obsidian was becoming more of a hindrance than a helper. I was using the daily notes feature of Obsidian. The problem is that I started to feel obligated to fill out my daily note, which had grown quite lengthy with "helpful" sections. It got to the point that I was taking time away from more productive efforts to keep my daily note streak going. Once I realized that this is what I was actually doing, I abandoned the digital note platform all together. I was actually able to have a conversation with Claude and develop a new strategy for using Obsidian along side my analog notes system as well as an all new Obsidian daily note template. I count this as a beneficial use case.

AI is also really helpful with mundane tasks like writing K8S Kustomize files and corresponding manifests. You do need to know what they should look like so that you can verify that they are correct. It is unadvisable to trust any AI tool to just write you something and then just use it in your infrastructure. But it generally does a good job. I have noticed that it **can** hallucinate with larger jobs though. But I built out a whole projects Kustomize infra with Claude:

[Project Acorn](https://github.com/donhamiltoniii/project-acorn)
