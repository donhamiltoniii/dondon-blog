I've recently been working a lot more with Claude Sonnet 4. I have a lot of conflicting feelings about AI. But I have been working with this tool in an effort to understand exactly what it does well and see if there is anything beneficial that I can incorporate into my workflow. It turns out, I have definitely found useful applications. I'm going to list anything I find useful here.

I have been using Claude Sonnet 4 as sort of a glorified search engine. Most recently, I have been trying to use Obsidian more effectively. I have been trying to use Obsidian as a complementary tool to my analog notebooks. I ran up against an issue where Obsidian was becoming more of a hindrance than a helper. I was using the daily notes feature of Obsidian. The problem is that I started to feel obligated to fill out my daily note, which had grown quite lengthy with "helpful" sections. It got to the point that I was taking time away from more productive efforts to keep my daily note streak going. Once I realized that this is what I was actually doing, I abandoned the digital note platform all together. I was actually able to have a conversation with Claude and develop a new strategy for using Obsidian along side my analog notes system as well as an all new Obsidian daily note template. I count this as a beneficial use case.
