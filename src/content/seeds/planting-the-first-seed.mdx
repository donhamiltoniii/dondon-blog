So I think I had a breakthrough with digital gardening today. I was talking about my personal site with a friend and I was talking about being frustrated with my lack of content. I realized that I'm struggling with something adjacent to perfectionism. It's not necessarily that I feel like I need to have a perfectly polished essay or anything to be able to write. But I've been trying to make these big posts. Something that I spend a lot of time on. Something that is complete.

**That's not the point of digital gardening!**

I'm supposed to come back to these things! Grow them! Like plants in a garden! Maybe that shold've been more obvious... But I eventually found myself here! So now I'm gonna do my best to post often and revisit the stuff I post. This is where I imagine most of my content will live until it grows enough to fit somewhere else.
