### Ingredients

For the pork:

- 1.5 lbs pork tenderloin
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon fresh thyme, chopped
- 1 tablespoon fresh rosemary, chopped
- 1 teaspoon lemon zest
- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper

For the farro:

- 1 cup farro, rinsed
- 3 cups low-sodium chicken broth
- 1 bay leaf
- 1/2 teaspoon salt

For the spring vegetables:

- 1 bunch asparagus (about 1 lb), woody ends removed, cut into 2-inch pieces
- 1 lb sugar snap peas, strings removed
- 2 cups fresh English peas (or frozen)
- 3 large spring onions or 6 scallions, cut into 2-inch pieces
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 teaspoon lemon zest
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 2 tablespoons fresh dill, chopped
- Salt and pepper to taste

### Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400째F (200째C). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
2. In a small bowl, combine olive oil, garlic, thyme, rosemary, lemon zest, Dijon mustard, salt, and pepper. Rub this mixture all over the pork tenderloin.
3. Place pork on one prepared baking sheet. Roast for 25-30 minutes or until internal temperature reaches 145째F (63째C). Let rest for 10 minutes before slicing.
4. Meanwhile, combine farro, chicken broth, bay leaf, and salt in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer for 30-35 minutes until tender but still chewy. Drain any excess liquid, remove bay leaf, and let cool slightly.
5. While pork and farro cook, prepare vegetables. In a large bowl, toss asparagus, sugar snap peas, peas, and spring onions with olive oil, salt, and pepper.
6. Spread vegetables on the second prepared baking sheet. Roast for 15-20 minutes, until tender-crisp and lightly browned.
7. Transfer roasted vegetables to a large bowl. Add lemon zest, lemon juice, and fresh dill. Toss to combine.
8. For meal prep, divide cooked farro among 4 containers. Top with sliced pork tenderloin and roasted spring vegetables.
