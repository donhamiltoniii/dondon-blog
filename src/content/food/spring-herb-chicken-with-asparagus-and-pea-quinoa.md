- 1.5 lbs boneless, skinless chicken breast
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons fresh tarragon, chopped
- 2 tablespoons fresh chives, chopped
- 1 tablespoon lemon zest
- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper

For the quinoa:

- 1 cup quinoa, rinsed
- 2 cups low-sodium chicken broth
- 1 bunch asparagus (about 1 lb), woody ends removed, cut into 1-inch pieces
- 1 cup fresh or frozen peas
- 1/4 cup fresh mint, chopped
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- 1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese (optional)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 lemon, cut into wedges for serving

### Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 425째F (220째C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. In a bowl, mix olive oil, garlic, tarragon, chives, lemon zest, Dijon mustard, salt and pepper.
3. Place chicken breasts on the prepared baking sheet and coat evenly with the herb mixture.
4. Roast chicken for 22-25 minutes, or until internal temperature reaches 165째F (74째C). Let rest for 5 minutes before slicing.
5. Meanwhile, combine quinoa and chicken broth in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 12 minutes.
6. Add asparagus pieces on top of the quinoa (do not stir yet), cover again, and cook for an additional 3 minutes.
7. Add peas on top, cover again, and remove from heat. Let stand for 5 minutes.
8. Fluff the quinoa mixture with a fork, mixing in the asparagus and peas. Transfer to a large bowl.
9. Add mint, lemon juice, olive oil, salt, and pepper to the quinoa mixture. Toss gently to combine.
10. For meal prep, divide quinoa mixture among 4 containers. Top with sliced chicken. If using, sprinkle feta cheese on top.
11. Include a lemon wedge in each container to squeeze over just before eating.
