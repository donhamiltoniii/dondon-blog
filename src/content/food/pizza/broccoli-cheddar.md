### Instructions

**Make the Pizza Dough:**
1. **Activate yeast:** Mix warm water, sugar, and yeast in a small bowl. Let sit 5-10 minutes until foamy.
2. **Form dough:** In a large bowl, combine flour and salt. Create a well in center and add foamy yeast mixture and olive oil. Mix until shaggy dough forms.
3. **Knead:** Turn onto floured surface and knead 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic.
4. **First rise:** Place in oiled bowl, cover with damp towel, and rise in warm spot 1-2 hours until doubled.

**Prepare the White Sauce:**
1. Melt butter in small saucepan over medium heat.
2. Add minced garlic and cook 30 seconds until fragrant.
3. Whisk in flour and cook 1 minute.
4. Gradually add milk, whisking constantly until smooth and thickened (2-3 minutes).
5. Stir in Parmesan, salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Set aside to cool slightly.

**Prepare the Toppings:**
1. Steam or blanch broccoli florets 2-3 minutes until bright green and slightly tender.
2. Drain well and pat completely dry with paper towels.
3. Mix minced garlic with olive oil in small bowl.

**Assemble and Bake:**
1. **Preheat oven** to 475°F (245°C).
2. **Roll dough:** Punch down risen dough and roll out on floured surface to fit your pizza pan or baking sheet.
3. **Add base:** Brush dough with garlic oil, then spread white sauce evenly, leaving a 1-inch border for crust.
4. **Add toppings:** Sprinkle mozzarella cheese first, then distribute broccoli florets evenly. Top generously with sharp cheddar cheese.
5. **Bake:** 12-15 minutes until crust is golden brown and cheese is bubbly and lightly browned.
6. **Cool and serve:** Let cool 2-3 minutes before slicing. Serve hot.
