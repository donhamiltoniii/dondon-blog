### Ingredients
- 3 large very ripe bananas, mashed (about 1½ cups)
- ½ cup plain Greek yogurt
- 2 large eggs
- ¼ cup honey or maple syrup
- 2 tablespoons melted coconut oil or butter
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ¾ cup whole wheat flour
- ¾ cup vanilla protein powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon
- ¼ teaspoon nutmeg
- ⅓ cup chopped walnuts (optional)

### Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan or line with parchment paper.

2. In a large bowl, mash bananas until mostly smooth with some small chunks remaining.

3. Whisk in Greek yogurt, eggs, honey, melted coconut oil, and vanilla extract until well combined.

4. In a separate bowl, whisk together flour, protein powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg.

5. Add dry ingredients to wet ingredients and gently fold together until just combined. Don't overmix.

6. Fold in walnuts if using.

7. Pour batter into prepared loaf pan and smooth the top.

8. Bake for 55-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in center comes out with just a few moist crumbs.

9. Cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely before slicing.
