### Ingredients
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 large red bell pepper, diced
- 1 large yellow bell pepper, diced
- 1 medium yellow onion, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon sweet paprika
- 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)
- 1 (14.5 oz) can diced tomatoes, drained
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- 6 large eggs
- 1/2 cup whole milk ricotta cheese
- 1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped
- 2 tablespoons olive oil for drizzling
- Crusty bread for serving (optional)

### Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish or large cast iron skillet.

2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add diced bell peppers and onion, cooking for 8-10 minutes until softened and slightly caramelized.

3. Add minced garlic, cumin, paprika, and red pepper flakes. Cook for another minute until fragrant.

4. Stir in drained diced tomatoes, salt, and pepper. Cook for 5 minutes, allowing some of the liquid to evaporate and flavors to meld.

5. Transfer the vegetable mixture to your prepared baking dish and spread evenly.

6. Using a spoon, create 6 wells in the vegetable mixture. Crack each egg into a small bowl first, then gently pour into each well.

7. Dot the ricotta cheese around the dish between the eggs.

8. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until egg whites are set but yolks are still slightly runny (cook longer if you prefer firmer yolks).

9. Remove from oven and immediately sprinkle with fresh parsley and drizzle with olive oil.

10. Serve hot directly from the baking dish with crusty bread if desired.
