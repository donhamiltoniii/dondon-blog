### Ingredients

For the meatballs:

- 1 lb ground lamb
- 1/4 cup fresh breadcrumbs
- 1 egg, beaten
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons fresh mint, finely chopped
- 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, finely chopped
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 tablespoon olive oil for cooking

For the bulgur:

- 1 cup bulgur wheat
- 2 cups low-sodium chicken broth
- 1 lemon, zested and juiced
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1/4 cup fresh mint, chopped
- 1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped
- 1/3 cup diced cucumber
- 1/4 cup chopped green onions
- Salt and pepper to taste

For the radishes:

- 2 bunches spring radishes (about 20 radishes), halved
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 teaspoon honey
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper

### Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400째F (200째C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. In a large bowl, combine all meatball ingredients except the olive oil. Mix gently with your hands until just combined (don't overmix).
3. Form into 16 meatballs (about 1-1/2 inch diameter each).
4. Heat olive oil in a large oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Brown the meatballs on all sides, about 2 minutes per side.
5. Transfer the skillet to the oven and bake for 10-12 minutes until meatballs reach an internal temperature of 160째F (71째C).
6. Meanwhile, prepare the bulgur: In a medium saucepan, bring chicken broth to a boil. Add bulgur, reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 12-15 minutes until tender and liquid is absorbed.
7. While bulgur cooks, prepare radishes: In a bowl, toss radishes with olive oil, honey, salt, and pepper. Spread on a baking sheet and roast in the oven alongside the meatballs for about 15 minutes, until tender and slightly caramelized.
8. When bulgur is done, transfer to a large bowl. Add lemon zest, lemon juice, olive oil, mint, parsley, cucumber, green onions, salt, and pepper. Toss to combine.
9. For meal prep, divide bulgur mixture among 4 containers. Top with 4 meatballs per container and a portion of roasted radishes.
