### Ingredients

For the pork:

- 1.5 lbs pork tenderloin (about 2 small tenderloins)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon fresh rosemary, chopped
- 1 teaspoon fresh thyme, chopped
- 1 lemon, zested and cut into wedges
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper

For the barley:

- 1 cup pearl barley, rinsed
- 3 cups low-sodium chicken broth
- 1/2 teaspoon salt

For the vegetables:

- 1 lb Brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved
- 1 small butternut squash (about 2 lbs), peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- Salt and pepper to taste

For serving:

- 1/4 cup pumpkin seeds
- 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

### Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400째F (200째C). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
2. Start with barley: Combine barley, broth, and salt in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer for 40-45 minutes until tender and liquid is absorbed. Let stand covered for 5 minutes, then fluff with a fork.
3. While barley is cooking, prepare vegetables: In a large bowl, toss Brussels sprouts and butternut squash with olive oil, thyme, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Spread on a prepared baking sheet in a single layer.
4. Roast vegetables for 25-30 minutes, stirring halfway, until tender and caramelized.
5. For the pork: In a small bowl, combine olive oil, garlic, rosemary, thyme, lemon zest, salt, and pepper. Rub this mixture all over the pork tenderloin.
6. Place pork on the second prepared baking sheet. Roast for 25-30 minutes or until internal temperature reaches 145째F (63째C). Let rest for 5-10 minutes before slicing.
7. In a dry skillet over medium heat, toast pumpkin seeds for 2-3 minutes until fragrant and lightly golden. Set aside.
8. For meal prep, divide cooked barley among 4 containers. Top with roasted vegetables and sliced pork tenderloin (about 6 oz per container).
9. Sprinkle each container with toasted pumpkin seeds, a squeeze of fresh lemon juice, and chopped parsley.
