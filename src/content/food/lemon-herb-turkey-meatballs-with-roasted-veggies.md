### Ingredients

For the meatballs:

- 1 lb (450g) lean ground turkey
- 1 egg, beaten
- 1/3 cup whole wheat breadcrumbs
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped
- 1 tablespoon fresh lemon zest
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper

For the vegetables:

- 2 cups Brussels sprouts, halved
- 2 cups carrots, cut into 1-inch pieces
- 2 cups parsnips, cut into 1-inch pieces
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- Salt and pepper to taste

For serving:

- 1 cup whole wheat orzo, uncooked

### Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400째F (200째C). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
2. In a large bowl, combine all meatball ingredients and mix gently until just combined (don't overmix). Form into 16 meatballs (about 1-1/2 inch diameter each).
3. Place meatballs on one prepared baking sheet.
4. In another bowl, toss Brussels sprouts, carrots, and parsnips with olive oil, thyme, salt, and pepper. Spread on the second baking sheet.
5. Place both baking sheets in the oven. Roast vegetables for 25-30 minutes, stirring halfway. Roast meatballs for 20-25 minutes or until internal temperature reaches 165째F (74째C).
6. Meanwhile, cook orzo according to package directions. Drain and toss with a drizzle of olive oil.
7. For meal prep, divide orzo between 4 containers. Top with 4 meatballs per container and a quarter of the roasted vegetables.
8. Include a lemon wedge in each container to squeeze over the dish before eating.
