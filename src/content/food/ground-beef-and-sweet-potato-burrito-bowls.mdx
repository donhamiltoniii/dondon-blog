### Ingredients

- 1 lb lean ground beef (90/10)
- 2 large sweet potatoes (about 1.5 lbs), cut into 1/2-inch cubes
- 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- 3 tablespoons taco seasoning, divided
- 1 cup frozen corn kernels, thawed
- 1 red bell pepper, diced
- 1 green bell pepper, diced
- 1/2 red onion, diced
- 1/4 cup lime juice (about 2 limes)
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- 2 cups cooked brown rice
- 1 avocado, sliced (to add before serving)
- 1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped (to add before serving)
- Optional: Salsa or hot sauce to serve

### Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. In a large bowl, toss sweet potato cubes with 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 tablespoon taco seasoning until evenly coated.
3. Spread sweet potatoes on the prepared baking sheet in a single layer. Roast for 25-30 minutes until tender and slightly caramelized, stirring halfway.
4. While sweet potatoes are roasting, heat remaining tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
5. Add red and green bell peppers and red onion. Sauté for 5-7 minutes until vegetables start to soften.
6. Push vegetables to one side of the pan and add ground beef to the other side. Cook, breaking it up with a spatula, until browned (about 5-7 minutes).
7. Add 2 tablespoons taco seasoning to the beef and stir to combine. Mix the beef with the vegetables.
8. Add corn to the skillet. Cook for another 2-3 minutes until heated through.
9. Stir in lime juice, salt, and pepper. Remove from heat.
10. For meal prep, divide brown rice among 4 containers. Top with roasted sweet potatoes and beef mixture.
11. Store cilantro and sliced avocado separately. Add just before eating to prevent browning.
