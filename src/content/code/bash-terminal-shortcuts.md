1. `ctrl + L` - Clears the terminal
2. `ctrl + D` - Closes the terminal. Same as the `exit` command
3. `ctrl + A` - Returns cursor to the beginning of the terminal line
4. `ctrl + E` - Move the cursor to the end of the line
5. `ctrl + U` - Cuts everything before the cursor. This is a great way to clear the line if you've written something that you want to delete
6. `ctrl + C` - Stops the current command
7. `ctrl + Z` - Puts the current running program to sleep
8. `ctrl + alt + T` - Opens a new terminal
