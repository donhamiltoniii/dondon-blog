In this post, I'll be going through [this article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-javascript-reactivity-build-signals-from-scratch/) to understand creating signals.

What I build will live [in this repository](https://github.com/donhamiltoniii/creating-signals-from-scratch). Feel free to check it out if you would like!

## Findings

Signals are really cool and are going to be a big part of the web moving forward I think. This sort of pub/sub architecture has always been a big part of the web. So it's increasingly important to be familiar with it. So let's dive into some of what I found interesting and applicable on a broader scale as well as some things that I will do differently in the future.

## The `Signal` Class

```tsx
class Signal {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.subscribers = [];
  }

  getValue() {
    return this.value;
  }

  setValue(newValue) {
    this.value = newValue;
    this.emit();
  }

  emit() {
    this.subscribers.forEach((subscriber) => subscriber(this.value));
  }

  subscribe(callback) {
    this.subscribers.push(callback);
  }
}
```

Encapsulating this logic into it's own class is a great idea. The real meat of what's happening here though is in that `subscribers` property.

## `createSignal`

```tsx
export const createSignal = (value) => {
  const signal = new Signal(value);

  return [
    function value() {
      if (effectCallback) {
        signal.subscribe(effectCallback);
      }
      return signal.getValue();
    },
    function setValue(newVal) {
      signal.setValue(newVal);
    },
  ];
};
```

## `createEffect`

```tsx
export const createEffect = (callback) => {
  effectCallback = callback;
  callback();
  effectCallback = null;
};
```

I am starting a series on building a reactive frontend framework similar to React and probably based more heavily on Chris Ferdinandi's [Reef](https://reefjs.com/) than I want it to be. But that is the matrerial through which I am going to be learning. So that's wont to happen.
