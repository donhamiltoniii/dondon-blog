## Scope

Week 1 to Week 13 of 2025. So from 2024-12-29 - 2025-03-29.

## Areas of Focus

For this quarter, I want to focus on narrowing the scope of my focus to a fitness goal, an artistic goal, and a creative goal. I will also start writing weekly updates of my progress and maybe publishing them?

## Fitness Goal

For my fitness goal, I want to go through the [Strength Side course that I bought](https://strengthside.com/apps/my/courses/list?course=movestrongnow&lesson=Schedule_114287). I will keep track of each day by writing about my progress in my daily note and then writing a comprehensive summary of my experience at the end. I plan to stop lifting weights for this period and see how it affects my body. At the end of this 90 days, I can assess if this is working better or worse for me and go from there.

### Definition of Done

I will consider this goal complete if I do at least 3 workouts a week for this quarter and document my findings.

## Artistic Goal

For my artistic goal, I want to get back into actively photographing things again. Maybe this means getting outside and shooting images for an hour. Maybe it means editing photos I've taken for an hour. It could be reading photo theory and applying it to my process. Either way, make some art and put it somewhere. If you make prints, hang them in the house or give them away as gifts. I would like to come up with a project or two in this quarter but I would like to let that happen more organically. Maybe that will be my sort of quarterly thesis project or something like that. Spend the last month or so focused on a project and make something specific to show.

### Definition of Done

I will consider this goal complete if I am more actively and intentionally capturing images in my day to day and if I have produced something that I am proud of in a way that I make prints and present it as a project by the end of the quarter.

## Creative Goal

I struggled with classifying this goal because creative feels like a cop out. I was gonna call this a logic goal or a computer goal but I realized it encompasses more than that. I want to get better at Linux administration. Ultimately this is going to be part of a larger goal of working with Kubernetes in a more regular capacity. Also this is the foundation of my homelab and knowledge base therein. So I feel like this goal is a bit more ambiguous. I want to finish this Udemy course: [Linux Sysadmin:Build 5 Hands-On Linux Projects for Real Jobs](https://www.udemy.com/course/linux-administration-build-hands-on-linux-projects/). But my Goal is to use what I learn in this course to host something on my existing server environment and make it accessible from the public internet. I think everything in this course will cover that and get me to that end. But if it doesn't, I will still use the skills from this course to build the things I am going to host and then explore past it to figure out how to successfully expose my apps to the internet at large without making myself vulnerable to attacks.

### Definition of Done

I will consider this goal complete if I have completed the course and have at least one application running and hosted on my local server that I can somehow access from any device via the public internet.
