1. generate an ssh key from the work station machine: `ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/<your-key-name>`
2. copy the new key from the work station machine to the agent machine: `ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/<your-key-name> <ip addr of agent machine>`
   1. example: `ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/home-lab-key 192.168.0.10`
3. make sure ssh-agent is running on workstation machine: `eval $(ssh-agent -s)`
4. add ssh key to registry for use: `ssh-add ~/.ssh/<your-key-name>`
   1. example: `ssh-add ~/.ssh/home-lab-key`
5. you should now be able to run: `ssh <ip addr of agent machine>` and connect to that machine
   1. example: `ssh 192.168.0.10`
