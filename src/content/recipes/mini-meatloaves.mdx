### Ingredients
- 2 pounds ground beef
- 1 cup breadcrumbs
- 1/2 cup milk
- 2 eggs, beaten
- 2 small onions, finely diced
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 teaspoon dried herbs (like oregano, thyme, or Italian seasoning)

**For the topping:**
- 1/2 cup ketchup
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons mustard

### Instructions
1. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and lightly grease a 12-cup muffin tin.
2. In a large bowl, combine all meatloaf ingredients and mix gently until just combined (don't overmix).
3. Divide the mixture evenly among the 12 muffin cups. They will be quite full.
4. Mix the topping ingredients in a small bowl and spoon over each mini meatloaf.
5. Bake for 25-30 minutes until cooked through (internal temperature of 160°F). The cooking time is slightly increased from the original recipe because each cup contains more mixture.
6. Let rest for 5 minutes before serving.
