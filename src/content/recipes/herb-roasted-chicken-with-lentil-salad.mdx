### Ingredients

For the chicken:

- 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 6 oz each)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon fresh rosemary, chopped
- 1 tablespoon fresh thyme, chopped
- 1 teaspoon lemon zest
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper

For the lentil salad:

- 1 cup dry green lentils, rinsed and picked over
- 3 cups low-sodium chicken or vegetable broth
- 1 pint cherry tomatoes, halved
- 1 English cucumber, diced
- 1/4 cup red onion, finely diced
- 1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped
- 2 tablespoons fresh mint, chopped (optional)

For the dressing:

- 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- 1 teaspoon honey
- Salt and pepper to taste

### Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 425째F (220째C).
2. In a small bowl, combine olive oil, garlic, rosemary, thyme, lemon zest, salt, and pepper. Rub this mixture all over the chicken breasts.
3. Place chicken on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Roast for 22-25 minutes, or until internal temperature reaches 165째F (74째C). Let rest for 5 minutes before slicing.
4. While chicken is cooking, prepare lentils. In a medium saucepan, combine lentils and broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to simmer. Cook uncovered for about 20-25 minutes until lentils are tender but not mushy. Drain any excess liquid.
5. In a large bowl, combine cooked lentils, cherry tomatoes, cucumber, red onion, parsley, and mint if using.
6. For the dressing, whisk together olive oil, red wine vinegar, Dijon mustard, honey, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. Pour over lentil mixture and toss to combine.
7. For meal prep, divide lentil salad among 4 containers. Top with sliced chicken breast.
