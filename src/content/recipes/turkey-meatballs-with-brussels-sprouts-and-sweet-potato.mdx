### Ingredients

**For the Turkey Meatballs:**

- 1 lb ground turkey (93% lean)
- 1/4 cup whole wheat breadcrumbs (or almond flour for lower carb)
- 1 large egg
- 1/4 cup finely grated onion (about 1/2 small onion)
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped
- 1 tsp dried Italian herbs
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp black pepper
- 1/4 tsp paprika

**For the Vegetables:**

- 2 medium sweet potatoes (about 1 lb), peeled and cubed into 3/4-inch pieces
- 1 lb Brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved
- 2 tbsp olive oil, divided
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tsp dried rosemary
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp black pepper
- Optional: 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar (for Brussels sprouts)

**For the Lemon-Garlic Yogurt Sauce:**

- 1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt
- 1 small lemon, zested and juiced
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 tbsp fresh herbs (dill, parsley, or chives)
- Salt and pepper to taste

### Instructions

1. **Preheat the oven** to 425째F (220째C). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or lightly grease with cooking spray.

2. **Prepare the meatballs:** In a large bowl, combine all meatball ingredients. Mix gently with your hands until just combined (don't overmix). Form into 16 meatballs (about 1.5 inches in diameter) and set aside.

3. **Prepare the vegetables:** In a medium bowl, toss the sweet potato cubes with 1 tbsp olive oil, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp dried rosemary, 1/4 tsp salt, and a pinch of black pepper. In another bowl, toss the Brussels sprouts with the remaining 1 tbsp olive oil, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp dried rosemary, 1/4 tsp salt, black pepper, and balsamic vinegar (if using).

4. **Arrange on sheet pan:** Place the sweet potatoes at one end of the prepared baking sheet and the Brussels sprouts at the other end, leaving space in the middle for the meatballs. Place the formed meatballs in the center of the sheet.

5. **Bake** for 20-25 minutes, until the meatballs reach an internal temperature of 165째F (74째C), the sweet potatoes are tender, and the Brussels sprouts are crispy on the edges. If needed, you can remove components that cook faster and continue cooking the rest.

6. **While everything bakes, prepare the sauce:** In a small bowl, combine all sauce ingredients and mix well. Refrigerate until ready to serve.

7. **Serve** the meatballs and roasted vegetables hot, with the lemon-garlic yogurt sauce drizzled on top or served on the side.
