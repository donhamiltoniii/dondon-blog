## Previous Quarter Review

## Fitness Goal

I think that I did well here. I wish that I would've started Strength Side one fucking week earlier so that I would've finished the program with the quarter. But that's fine. I'm going to continue doing this program for the next quarter anyway. So this time, I actually will end with the quarter. But as far as progress, I've made quite a bit. I'm pretty excited for how my push ups are looking and my pull ups are coming along too

## Artistic Goal

This was a fail. Straight up and down. There's no way around it. Insofar as I did not even approach my goal of "actively and intentionally capturing images in my day to day". I did, however, learn a lot about my process through the other goals that I made for myself. So I think I have a good plan for this coming quarter. I need to play into the things that I'm inherentlt driven to do. So if I can make a self-hosting project out of photography and build hardware around it (like a dedicated work station for photo editing), I'm going to be more successful. I think this is going to be a good way to combine both of these efforts.

## Creative Goal

I crushed this shit. I'm so fucking passionate about this part. Learning to self host and use server environments more efficiently to the point that I can actually build tools that I can use in personal projects is awesome. I have a K8S homelab setup that I built following MVDB's Skool course. I'm in the process of going through another, in-depth Docker/Kubernetes course. And then, once I have a better handle on K8S itself, I'm gonna go through another course (or maybe courses? IDR) for K8S and FluxCD. So I can get more hands on experience with working with K8S with YAML manifests. But I think working more hands on first is going to be beneficial. Learn the tool before you automate the boring stuff. Oh yea: [My self-hosted LinkDing instance](https://linkding.dondon.wtf)

# This Quarter

## Scope

Week 14 to Week 26 of 2025. So from [[2025-03-30]] - [[2025-06-28]].

## Areas of Focus

**Body::** Do Strength Side again
**Right Brain::** Setup a workstation for photo editing and document the rest of this pregnancy
**Left Brain::** Be better at Docker and Kubernetes

## Body

Last quarter, [Strength Side](https://strengthside.com/apps/my/courses/list?course=movestrongnow&lesson=Schedule_114287) went so well that I am going to continue down this calisthenics path this quarter as well. I may start trying to lift again in Q3 but we'll see what happens. That's a conversation with myself that will need to be had later. Similar goal though, try to go through the whole Strength Side 3 months and do the harder variations of each exercise. I feel way better and I definitely feel like I'm moving around better.

### DoD

I will consider this goal complete if I do at least 3 workouts a week for this quarter and document my findings.

## Right Brain

Last quarter I fell flat on my face with this goal. But in trying to pursue it, I learned a lot about myself and my process. I am fully into self-hosting and trying to make my own services on my home network. I need to incorporate that into my Art goal. Not let it steal the show or anything. But play into my current interests. I broke down and spent money in a way that I was trying to avoid doing. But, tbh, I think it's gonna be good for me as it applies to this goal. I bought myself a [Ricoh GR III Street Edition](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LM9BLN2). I do not need a new camera but I really do think this is gonna help me take more photos. Because of the size of this camera as well as the settings available in such a small package, I think I'm gonna be able to have this camera with me in more scenarios than my Nikon Z5. And that's definitely a lesson I've learned about myself over time. I need to have tools available to use them. I am inherently lazy and I will actively not do something if there are too many barriers to entry. So while this is a superfluous purchase, I think it's gonna end up being really worthwhile.

### DoD

This goal will be complete if I am taking photos more regularly and publishing them to a self-hosted blog or something similar. I don't want to constrain myself too much here as my next goal will inform what my publishing platform will be

## Left Brain

So I feel like I was REALLY taken by [Chris Ferdinandi's post about digital gardening](https://gomakethings.com/the-joy-of-digital-gardening/). This shit speaks to me like viscerally. This is what excites me about the web. This is what made me want to be a designer and illustrator as a kid, it's what gave me any interest in "building web sites" and later programming. In a lot of ways, this sort of early web mentality of like the DIY or punk web or whatever you want to call it, shaped me as a person. And I want so badly to get back to that. Just build shit because it makes me happy and it gives me a creative way to interact with the people around me. And it gives me a reason to learn different technologies and processes. So I want to continue on this journey that I'm on to learn and use Docker and Kubernetes more so that I can build whatever I want and deliver it to the people that I care about.

### Definition of Done

I have done more learning on Docker and K8S, I have a more robust homelab/home network, and I am self-hosting more services for my own consumption, thereby reducing the number of services I use from large toxic tech companies, but also serving my own digital spaces for my own creative work.
