If you ever run into a build error with any package that looks like this:

```bash
12:06:28 PM: $ yarn build
12:06:28 PM: yarn run v1.22.10
12:06:28 PM: $ next build

```

The current fix is to add the following to your `package.json`

```jsonc
}
  // ...
  "resolutions": {
    "@types/react": "17.0.40"
  }
}
```
