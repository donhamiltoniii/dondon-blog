How to return focus to a modal trigger once that modal gets closed.

1. Put the id of that element (or some identifying attribute) in local storage when the element is clicked
2. Use modal as necessary
3. When the close button of the modal is closed, use local storage to identify the triggering element and use `.focus()` to give it focus, close the modal, and then remove that id from local storage
